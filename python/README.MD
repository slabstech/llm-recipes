Warehouse


Ideas 

1. Use drone to map a warehouse . Create a 3d map along with items .
2. Connect to Internal Api with function calling map metadata of items into 3d map
3. Provide route list for the worker/robot with list of possible items which expire in 30/15/7 days

  - Challenge 3 - Eat HealthAI – AI for less food waste

Despite ever-increasing efforts, more than 11 million tons of food still end up in the trash every year in Germany alone because it is not sold in time before the expiration date and can therefore no longer be donated.

What technological solutions can be developed to reduce food waste and promote sustainability in retail? Consider using state-of-the-art industrial cameras, AI algorithms for image recognition and innovative systems for identifying and managing food that needs to be consumed urgently.

Challenge Partner: SICK AG
